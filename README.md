# Volunteering Managment System
The project is aimed at creating an application to make it easier for teen volunteers to access and manage volunteering opportunities. 

# The aim of the project
 is to make the organization's material more accessible to all volunteers and volunteering locations. We aim to create a more accessible application for volunteers, with the ability to distribute data to volunteers, as well as create a request system for volunteers and schools, with the ability to open a dialogue between different positions on various topics. We will also create a system for tracking volunteer hours and making their private information available (hours of volunteering and the fixed location of volunteering, plus reminders to go to volunteering). The system will also have the ability to automatically generate signed forms to save time for coordinators. Additionally, there will be data analysis options for the management.

# Functional Requirements Of The Application
-Require users to authenticate by logging into registered accounts.  
-Provide push notifications to all users for receiving updates and messages.  
-Allow volunteers to view and join events created by the management.  
-Enable management to extract student details and lists in Excel format with sort and search capabilities.  
-Allow management to view and edit relevant student information as required.  

# Non-Functional Requirements of The Application
-Be accessible 24/7.  
-Have a minimalist design to optimize the user experience for teen volunteers.  
-Have fast loading times and responsive design across all devices and browsers (load within 3 seconds max).  
-Be scalable to accommodate a growing user base and increasing data volume.  
-The system must consistently perform well and handle high traffic without downtime or errors.
